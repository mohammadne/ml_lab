      " Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using that information), reasoning (using logic, mathematics, and common sense to solve problems), and self-correction. The goal of AI is to create systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This can range from simple tasks like voice recognition or driving a car, to complex tasks like understanding natural language, recognizing patterns in large datasets, and making decisions based on those patterns. AI can be categorized as either weak AI (designed to perform a specific task) or strong AI (able to understand, learn, and respond like a human across virtually all tasks)."
